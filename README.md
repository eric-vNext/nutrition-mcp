# Nutrition MCP

A remote MCP server for personal nutrition tracking — log meals with calories, macros, fiber, total sugar and caffeine, log water and body weight, review nutrition history, and import an existing food diary from another app, all through conversation. Alcohol tracking is opt-in and off by default.

## Quick Start

Already hosted and ready to use — just connect it to your MCP client:

```
https://nutrition-mcp.com/mcp
```

**On Claude.ai:** Customize → Connectors → + → Add custom connector → paste the URL → Connect

On first connect you'll be asked to register with an email and password. Your data persists across reconnections.

Switching from another tracker? See the [nutrition-app alternatives](https://nutrition-mcp.com/alternatives) — how it compares to [MyFitnessPal](https://nutrition-mcp.com/myfitnesspal-mcp), [Cronometer](https://nutrition-mcp.com/cronometer-mcp), [Lose It!](https://nutrition-mcp.com/lose-it-mcp), [MacroFactor](https://nutrition-mcp.com/macrofactor-mcp), [Yazio](https://nutrition-mcp.com/yazio-mcp), and [Lifesum](https://nutrition-mcp.com/lifesum-mcp). Bring your history with you: say "import my meals" and an importer opens in the chat, where you pick the CSV you exported from your old app, map its columns, and check what will be added before anything is saved. Exports from MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Lose It! and MacroFactor are recognised automatically; any other CSV works by mapping its columns yourself. In clients that can't show in-chat panels, paste the export instead and the AI imports it for you. If your export has an alcohol column and you want it kept, turn alcohol tracking on before importing — the importer skips that column while tracking is off, and re-importing the same file later won't backfill it.

## Self-hosting

### 1. Supabase setup

1. Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project.
2. Enable **Email Auth** (Authentication → Providers → Email) and disable email confirmation.
3. Apply the schema. The full schema lives in [`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/). With the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started):

    ```bash
    supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
    supabase db push
    ```

    This creates every table, index, RLS policy, and foreign key the app needs. No local Postgres is involved — migrations run against your hosted project.

4. Copy the **service role key** from Project Settings → API and use it as `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`.

### 2. Environment variables

| Variable               | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_URL`         | Your Supabase project URL                                                     |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`  | Supabase service role key (bypasses RLS)                                      |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`      | Random string for OAuth client identification                                 |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`  | Random string for OAuth client authentication                                 |
| `OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS` | Comma-separated exact-match allow-list for `/authorize`'s `redirect_uri`. Use `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback,https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback` for Claude.ai; add any other client's registered `redirect_uri` (visible in the `registered_clients` table after it first connects) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | _(optional)_ Google OAuth client ID for "Sign in with Google"                 |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | _(optional)_ Google OAuth client secret                                       |
| `OFF_USER_AGENT`       | Open Food Facts User-Agent for barcode lookups, in the form `AppName (email)` |
| `PORT`                 | Server port (default: `8080`)                                                 |

> **Making it yours:** The public site includes the maintainer's personal bits — Google Analytics, Patreon/GitHub/contact links, and the `nutrition-mcp.com` domain. Run `bun run depersonalize` to strip them all in one pass (analytics + CSP, the Support/Contact sections, social links, and the domain → a `your-domain.com` placeholder). Use `bun run depersonalize --dry` to preview without writing. Afterwards, swap in your own `public/og.png`, `favicon.ico`, and `apple-touch-icon.png`, and replace the domain placeholder with your real domain.

Generate OAuth credentials:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 16   # use as OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
openssl rand -hex 32   # use as OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 3. Google sign-in (optional)

Email/password works out of the box. To also offer **"Continue with Google"**,
follow [`docs/google-auth-setup.md`](docs/google-auth-setup.md) to create a
Google OAuth client, enable the Google provider in Supabase, and set
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Development

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your credentials
bun run dev             # starts with hot reload on http://localhost:8080
```
